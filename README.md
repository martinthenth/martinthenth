# 👋 Hey there - I'm Martin Nijboer

I'm a **software engineer** looking for exciting, and challenging projects. My specialization is **backend engineering**, with a focus on building scalable systems with the **Elixir** programming language.

My goal is to continuously improve myself, build new things, and having fun while doing that.

- I write blogs at **[dev.to/martinthenth](https://dev.to/martinthenth)**.
