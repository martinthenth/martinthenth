# 👋 Hey there - I'm Martin Nijboer

I'm a **software engineer** working on exciting, and challenging projects. My specialty is **backend engineering**, focussing on building scalable systems with the **Elixir** programming language. My goal is to continuously improve myself, build new things, and have fun while doing that.

### 👨‍💻 Now

- I work at **[Fresha](https://www.fresha.com)** as **Backend engineer**. We're building the operating system for the beauty and wellness industry 💇💅.
- I have experience working with **software architecture** and **distributed systems**, focusing on microservices with **Kafka**, **Redis**, **Elasticsearch** and **PostgreSQL**.
- I write blogs at **[dev.to/martinthenth](https://dev.to/martinthenth)**.
- I maintain a HTTP and LiveView parameter validation library called **[Goal](https://github.com/martinthenth/goal)**.
- As well as a UUID version 7 implementation for Elixir called **[UUIDv7](https://github.com/martinthenth/uuidv7)**.
